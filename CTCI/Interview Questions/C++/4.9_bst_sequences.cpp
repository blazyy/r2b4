// A binary search tree was created by traversing through an array form left to right and inserting each element. Given a binary searach tree with distinct elements, print all possible arrays that could have led to this tree.
// Example:
// Input:
//                   2
//                 /  \
//                1    3
// Output: {2, 1, 3}, {2, 3, 1}
