# Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of thr two subtrees of nay node never differ by more than one.

from binarytree import tree

# def is_balanced()

my_tree = tree(height=5, is_perfect=False) # tree() returns the root node of the tree.
print(my_tree)
